# Architecture for Legal RAG Application with Model Context Protocol

## Overview
This document outlines the architecture for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application designed for small law firms using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The system is optimized for handling legal documents and providing intelligent retrieval and generation capabilities.

## System Components

### 1. Database Layer
- Document metadata storage
- User session management
- Case and client information
- Document relationships and classifications

### 2. Model Context Protocol Integration
- MCP resources for read-only data access
- MCP tools for document manipulation
- Context-aware retrieval mechanisms
- Live, authoritative information access

### 3. Google Drive Integration
- Secure document storage
- Automatic folder organization
- Version control for legal documents
- Access control and permissions

### 4. Document Processing
- Multi-format document parsing (PDF, DOCX, images, video)
- OCR for scanned documents
- Transcript processing
- Metadata extraction
- Document chunking for efficient retrieval

### 5. RAG Engine
- Semantic search capabilities
- Context-aware retrieval
- Legal-specific knowledge integration
- Citation and reference management

### 6. Output Generation
- PDF report creation
- Legal document formatting
- Timeline visualization
- Case summary generation

## Data Flow

1. Documents are uploaded through the Google Drive interface
2. Document processor extracts text and metadata
3. MCP server indexes and organizes information
4. RAG engine provides retrieval capabilities
5. Output generator creates formatted reports and documents

## Technical Specifications

- Python-based backend
- RESTful API for client interactions
- Secure authentication and authorization
- Scalable architecture for growing document collections
- Compliance with legal data handling requirements

## Deployment Architecture

- Containerized application components
- Cloud-based deployment (Google Cloud Platform)
- Database backup and recovery mechanisms
- Monitoring and logging infrastructure
